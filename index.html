				<h2>About me</h2>
				<p>I was born on 5th December 2003 in Saint-Cloud, a little town near Paris. I studied in a small middle and high school before entering a preparatory class in Notre-Dame de Grandchamp in Versailles, which led me to become a HEC student this year.</p>

				<h2>My hobbies</h2>
				<p>I'm a big movie addict. I can watch up to 3 films per day and I regularly go to movie festivals. I also love any artistic activity, especially scrapbooking and collages. I also often go to music festivals. I also play volleyball when I'm with my friends and I started rowing this year (I quite like it but I don't think I'll keep on rowing newt year). I'm going on an exchange program in Hong-Kong in January, I'm super excited about it !</p>
